# Portfolio Showcase Project

Welcome to my portfolio showcase project! This project is a representation of my professional portfolio.

## Introduction

I've aimed to innovate the user interface by making the screens draggable, enhancing the user experience.

The entire application is designed to be responsive, with breakpoints carefully considered to ensure optimal display across various devices. I've followed the mobile-first principle in designing the architecture.

Please note that authentication routes are currently under construction. I'm implementing access control, JSON Web Tokens, and access token persistence.

I plan to refactor the code according to best practices, adhering to the Clean Code principles.

## Technologies and Tools

This project utilizes a range of technologies and tools, including:

- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- MongoDB (Local and Atlas)
- Docker
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Netlify and Heroku
- Postman for testing
- Redux Toolkit / Query for state management

## API Routes

- `/users`: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE
- `/messages`: GET / POST / PUT / DELETE
- `/auth`: POST (Under development)
- `/auth/refresh`: GET (Under development)
- `/auth/logout`: POST (Under development)

Please note that the main page is public. I've implemented context to restrict component access based on authentication level.

## Future Plans

I'm planning to implement tests for this project. For this project for personal reasons I will do it after publishing tests for different browsers:
- Architecture Testing
- End-to-End Testing
- Functional Testing

These tests will be carried out after deployment, as currently, personal time constraints prevent me from addressing this aspect.
